Files for analysis of the Mossbauer spectroscopy experiment

[Mossbauer Full Analysis](https://github.com/Physics431/mossbauer-spectroscopy/blob/main/Mossbauer%20Full%20Analysis%20(Template).ipynb) Use this if you want to analyze the raw spectrum files directly before calculating final results.

[Mossbauer Results-Only Analysis](https://github.com/Physics431/mossbauer-spectroscopy/blob/main/Mossbauer%20Results-Only%20Analysis%20(Template).ipynb) Use this if you want to calculate final results only from spreadsheet files conatining the peak positions and their widths, along with the incertainty in these, in units of channel numbers.

[Composite Model Demo](https://github.com/Physics431/mossbauer-spectroscopy/blob/main/Composite%20Model%20Demo%20Mossbauer.ipynb) shows how to construct a multi-peak fitting model plus background that allows you to fit a curve to a full spectrum.  It uses the associated data file.
