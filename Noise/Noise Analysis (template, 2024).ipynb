    "#### This template assumes use of the new shot noise source\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this template to carry out the analysis tasks for the Noise experiment.  For reference, here are links to recommended Python resources: the [Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://jakevdp.github.io/WhirlwindTourOfPython/) and the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) both by Jake VanderPlas.\n",
    "## First, import some packages\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a good idea at the beginning of your notebook to include the packages that you will need.  We will use those shown below here.  A brief description:\n",
    "* `numpy` is the foundational package for Python numerical work. It extends and speeds up array operations beyond standard Python, and it includes almost all math functions that you would need for example `sqrt()` (square root) or `cos()` (cosine).  These would be written in code as `np.sqrt()` or `np.cos()`.\n",
    "* `scipy` is a huge collection of scientific data analysis functions, routines, physicical constants, etc.  This is the second most used package for scientific work. Here we will use the physical constants library, `scipy.constants`.  Documentation is at [SciPy.org](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/) with the constants subpackage at https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/constants.html.\n",
    "* `uncertainties` is a very useful small package that simplifies uncertainty propagation and printing out of quantities with uncertainty. Documentation is at https://pythonhosted.org/uncertainties/\n",
    "* `matplotlib` is *the* standard plotting package for scientific Python.  We will use a subset called `pyplot` which is modeled after the plotting functions used in MATLAB. The last line below, `%matplotlib inline`, simply forces the plots to appear within the notebook.\n",
    "* `pandas` is a large data science package.  It's main feature is a set of methods to create and manipulate a \"DataFrame,\" which is an enlargement of the idea of an array.  I plays well with NumPy and other packages.  We will use it mainly as a way to read files into data sets in an easy way.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also use the [LMFit](https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/) package to make line fits.  This will be explained later in the notebook."

    "**About Data Files:** This template assumes that the data files will have one of two types of structure: \n",
    "1. If you took 5 readings (or so) for each measurement and plan to average them here, the assumed structure is one where each spreadsheet column is named with the resistance (for Johnson Noise), e.g., \"9.99k\", or the emission current (for shot noise), e.g., \"0.1047mA\" and each row of the data is one trial with each cell containing the measured RMS voltage in the frequency band; \n",
    "2. If you opted instead to simply take one longer-average time measurement for each resistance (or emission current), then the assumed structure would be two columns, the first column headed with resistance (or emission current) and the second column headed with the measured RMS voltage in the frequency band.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, these structures are treated by the designation \"1\" or \"2\".  Stucture type \"1\" requires a little more effort to reduce, but offers the option of calculating data point uncertainties. \n",
